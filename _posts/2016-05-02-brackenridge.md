Brackenridge itself also has a recreation area and kitchenette for its residents. The coed dormitory was can host 128 students (one of the smallest on campus) spread throughout four floors. It features community bathrooms and movable furniture in each room. Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, Gregory Gym and the PCL are all within close proximity to Brackenridge.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"It was an old dorm and I wouldn't have lived there without needing a dorm when my apartment fell through sophomore year, but it turned out amazingly. Don't worry about newness of dorms or glamor. That usually will end up being a con rather than a pro." 

#####Taylor, advertising senior#####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

#####Alena Savera, Architecture Senior#####

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
