Creekside, built in 1955, is the University of Texasâ€™ only all male residence hall. It can hold 190 men throughout two floors. Dorm room furniture is built into each room, and residents share community bathrooms as well as a computer lab. It features a sand volleyball court, barbecue pits, a kitchenette, and 24-hour visitation. The dormitory is uniquely situated on campus. It stands in the northeast section of the 40 Acres surrounded by the Cockrell School of Engineering buildings, Performing Arts Center, Butler School of Music buildings, and the fine arts buildings.

##Pros##

> Here's a cool short blockquote that sums up good feelings about San Jacinto.

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"Loved living in the dorms. While I miss not having a kitchen and having more space and privacy, I felt like it was well worth it to live on campus. I met my best friends on my floor, including my roommate. It's convenient to have Cypress Bend on the ground floor of my dorm, with JCL close by. San Jac definitely feels like one of the safest and most welcoming dorms too." 

#####Angelo Cioffi, Computer Science Freshman#####

"I loved living in San Jacinto. It was a dorm full of fun and smart people. I made all of my friends there freshman year, and always had people to eat with, watch movies with, go out with, etc. There were always plenty of places to study and hang out with others, and the building is incredibly designed to last for several years. My only dislike is the size of the rooms, but it's part of the college experience."

"Great! I just wish the walls were a little thicker, the microwave actually heated up food, the water pressure in the sink was higher, and the dryers actually worked."
